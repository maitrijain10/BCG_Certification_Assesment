# BCG_Certification_Assesment
This repository showcases a practical application of data analysis and Artificial Intelligence in the financial domain, developed as part of a BCG certification. The project focuses on transforming raw financial data into actionable insights and building an AI-powered chatbot prototype that can interpret and communicate these insights effectively.

It provides a hands-on exposure to how leading consulting firms approach real-world business problems using data science and AI, covering everything from fundamental financial concepts to advanced data visualization and basic chatbot development.

**Key Features & Learnings**
- Financial Data Extraction & Cleaning: Acquired practical experience in preparing unstructured or semi-structured financial data (simulated 10-K filings for Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla) for analysis, including handling common issues like data types, formatting, and missing values.

 Core Financial Analysis: Learned and applied fundamental financial concepts and calculations:
- Year-over-year growth rates (Revenue, Net Income, Assets, Liabilities, Operating Cash Flow).
- Key profitability ratios (Net Profit Margin).
- Key solvency/leverage ratios (Debt-to-Assets Ratio).
- Efficiency Ratios (Asset Turnover, Return on Assets, Return on Equity, Operating Cash Flow Margin).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed comprehensive EDA using Python's pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to understand data distributions, trends over time, and comparative performance across companies.
- Generated line plots for time series trends.
- Created bar charts for comparative analysis of latest year metrics.
- Developed grid subplots for visualizing data distributions (histograms and box plots).
- Analyzed correlations between financial metrics.

Real-world Problem Solving: Gained insights into how top consulting firms structure data-driven solutions for business challenges, from data preparation to interactive insights delivery.

**Dataset**
The project utilizes a simulated financial dataset provided as BCG - Sheet1.csv. This CSV contains key financial metrics (Total Revenue, Net Income, Total Assets, Total Liabilities, Cash Flow from Operating Activities) for Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla across multiple fiscal years (2020-2023), mimicking data typically extracted from public financial filings (10-K reports).

**Project Structure**
The core components of this project include:
- BCG - Sheet1.csv: The raw financial dataset.
- Jupyter Notebook / Python Scripts: (Implicitly represented by the conversational steps) Contain the Python code for data loading, cleaning, financial calculations, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- React Chatbot Application: The main AI chatbot prototype (provided as App.js equivalent code in the conversation).
